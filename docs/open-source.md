Environment Manager is open sourced under the [Apache 2 License](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0).

It was developed primarily for Trainlineâ€™s needs so there will be some rough edges and aspects that may not suit your infrastructure e.g. assumptions about AWS resource naming. No code base is ever good enough, but we hope that the most likely changes will be relatively easy to achieve.

Trainline will use the open source version internally from now on, not a separate fork. This means we will continue to add features and improve the code base - including improvements for the wider community such as reducing dependencies, simplifying setup and removing Trainline specific assumptions.

Environment Manager changes will be tagged in the Git repository using [SemVer](http://semver.org/) versioning.

Contributions via pull requests are welcome if they appear useful to a broader audience. For bigger changes it is recommended to contact us first to find out more details about our roadmap.

Let us know what you think!
