Consul supports security measures through different methods, the only one that is of concern to Environment Manager is the [ACL model](https://www.consul.io/docs/internals/acl.html).

Environment Manager uses ACLs to protect the Key Value store sections that hold target state for deployments. If this is not protected, itâ€™s possible other scripts or users in your estate could add or modify this data in a way that creates an inconsistent deployment state.

If you decide to use ACLs there are 3 policies that you can apply:

- Policy that allows Environment Manager to write new deployment state
- Policy that allows the Deployment Agent running on instances to read deployment state and upload deployment logs
- Policy that allows Upstreamer to read target deployment state

These policies can be found in GIT LINK:here.
