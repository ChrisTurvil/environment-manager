Environment Manager is a simple self-service web portal designed to help organisations manage AWS infrastructure at scale.

The portal enables development teams to perform common infrastructure tasks themselves at a natural level of abstraction. This includes creating and refreshing environments, deploying applications, and managing load balancer rules.

Environment Manager also provides a set of APIs for integrating these features into pipelines and other automation.

Finally, it includes operational and governance elements that improve visibility of environment status, deployments and infrastructure configuration changes.
