Environment Manager is a minimally opinionated platform that enables continuous delivery of software components into Windows and Linux AWS environments. 

It features blue/green, canary and overwrite deployments; multi-tenancy support; a comprehensive API for scripting deployments into pipelines; as well as audit capabilities suitable for a PCI Level 1 organisation.

Environment Manager provides 3 main facilities:

-	A simple website that enables development teams to perform common infrastructure tasks themselves at a natural level of abstraction. This includes creating and refreshing environments, deploying applications, and managing load balancer rules
-	A set of APIs for easily integrating deployment and management features into pipelines and other automation
-	Operational and governance elements that improve visibility of environment status, deployments, security considerations and configuration changes
